"""# Functions - Assignment-3 - Using Bisection Search to Make
 the Program Faster
# You'll notice that in Problem 2, your monthly payment had to be a
 multiple of $10. Why did we cent amount (in other words, the monthly
  payment is a multiple of $0.01).
# Does your code still work? It should, but you may notice that your
 code runs more slowly,
 especially in cases with very large balances and interest rates.
  (Note: when your code is
 running on our servers, there are limits on the amount of computing
  time each submission
# is allowed, so your observations from running this experiment on the grading system might be
limited to an error message complaining about too much time taken.)

# Well then, how can we calculate a more accurate fixed monthly payment
 than we did in Problem 2 without running into the problem of slow
# code?
# We can make this program run faster using a technique introduced in lecture - bisection search!

# The following variables contain values as described below:
# balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
# annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

# To recap the problem: we are searching for the smallest monthly payment such
 that we can pay off the entire balance within a year. What
# is a reasonable lower bound for this payment value? $0 is the obvious anwer,
 but you can do better than that. If there was no interest,
# the debt can be paid off by monthly payments of one-twelfth of the original
 balance, so we must pay at least this much every month.
# One-twelfth of the original balance is a good lower bound.

# What is a good upper bound? Imagine that instead of paying monthly, we paid
 off the entire balance at the end of the year. What we
# ultimately pay must be greater than what we would've paid in monthly installments,
 because the interest was compounded on the balance
# we didn't pay off each month. So a good upper bound for the
 monthly payment would be one-twelfth of the balance, after having its
# interest compounded monthly for an entire year."""

    # Write a program that uses these bounds and bisection search (for more info check
     out the Wikipedia page on bisection search) to find
    # the smallest monthly payment to the cent (no more multiples of $10) such that we
     can pay off the debt within a year. Try it out with
